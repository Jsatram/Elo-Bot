# About
This is a repos that contains 2 class files one that creates a simple Neural Network where the end-user can choose the number of input nodes, hidden nodes, and output nodes this Neural Network can be applied to many programs and games. I personally have applied this to a few things, a game of pong, a modified version of pong where it juggles 2 balls and currently working on a 2D scrolling game to try it on.
