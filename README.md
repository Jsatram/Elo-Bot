# About
This is discord bot that was made for the hundreds of Art Of Victory dicord members. This bot calculates and stores users Elo rating, Wins, Losses, winstreak, username, userid, elo bonus, etc. The bot uses all of this information to form the most balanced teams possible for competitive matches. This bot was made because the COD community has a large void that has yet to be filled by the game developers. The users want a good well balanced rating system that rewards skill vs how often you play. Since this system is a result based system meaning it is based on winning or losing it dosen't reward the players for player often but rather winning.
